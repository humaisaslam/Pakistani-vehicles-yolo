## 📋 Overview

This repository provides the core components for a sophisticated vehicle monitoring system. By combining **YOLOv11** for high-speed detection, **SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)** for vehicle continuity, and **OCR** for license plate authentication, this system offers a complete end-to-end computer vision solution.

## 🎯 Key Features

* **Advanced Detection:** Utilizes **YOLOv11** weights trained on 10 specific vehicle classes.
* **Persistent Tracking:** Implements the **SORT** algorithm to maintain unique IDs for vehicles across frames.
* **License Plate Recognition:** Integrated **OCR** for automated vehicle authentication.
* **Web-Based Interface:** A Flask-powered dashboard for real-time monitoring and data visualization.
